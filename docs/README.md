#THIAGO MENDONÇA'S PORTFOLIO
Hello, world!

I'm Thiago Mendonça, a Biotechnologist with a Master's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, currently in the final stages of completing my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.

My initial exposure to bioinformatics occurred during my undergraduate exchange program in Canada. The very first lesson was all about the Monte-Carlo Algorithm, followed by 5 hours of R prectice. It was a bit of a shock to me, so much math and computation! I was determined to avoid bioinformatics as much as possible. Until my Master's program, I had been exclusively involved in wet lab molecular biology techniques. However, my project in the Master's program required me to dig into transcriptomics, which meant 100% in silico work. To my surprise, I found myself developing an affinity for it. The endless possibilities and beautiful graphs were joy to my eyes. Now, I spend my time conducting detailed and in-depth computational analyses using programming languages such as Python, R, and Bash to perform various biological experiments and analyses. Take a quick look at it!
